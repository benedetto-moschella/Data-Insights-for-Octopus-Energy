## Introduction

Welcome to the "Visualizing Green Energy Solutions: Data Insights for Octopus Energy" project. This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that provides valuable insights into energy consumption patterns and renewable energy trends, specifically for Octopus Energy. The goal is to leverage data visualization to promote efficient energy usage and support the transition to 100% renewable energy sources.

This project is part of an initiative presented by BrainStation in collaboration with Octopus Energy. It aims to empower users, from consumers to stakeholders, by providing intuitive visualizations that help make informed decisions about energy consumption.

## Project Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

```
├── Data_Insights.ipynb       # Main Jupyter Notebook with data analysis and visualizations
├── data                      # Directory containing data files (not included in the repository)
├── README.md                 # Project README file
├── requirements.txt          # Required Python libraries
└── LICENSE                   # Project license
```

## Installation

To run the notebook locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/green-energy-visualizations.git
    cd green-energy-visualizations
    ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
    ```bash
    python -m venv env
    source env/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `env\Scriptsctivate`
    ```

3. **Install the required libraries:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. **Launch Jupyter Notebook:**
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```

## Usage

Open the `Data_Insights.ipynb` notebook and run the cells sequentially to reproduce the analysis and visualizations. The notebook is divided into several sections:

1. **Introduction**: Overview and objectives of the project.
2. **Import Libraries**: Loading necessary Python libraries.
3. **Cleaning and EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)**:
   - Visualization of Energy Trends
   - Data Transformation and Visualization for Hourly Energy Pricing
   - Analyzing Solar Energy Generation by Hour
   - Analysis of Wind Energy Generation Trends
   - Visualizing Hourly Energy Demand
   - Visualizing Ideal Hourly Energy Demand
4. **Conclusion**: Summary of findings and insights.
